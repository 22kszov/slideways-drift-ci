## **Design**

---

### **Fonts**

* I used google fonts to import 2 fonts. These were *Montserrat* which I used for headings and *roboto* which I used for main body content. These fonts were used to compliment the blogs simplistic design.

### **Colors**

* I used <https://coolors.co/> to create my color palette.

![Color pallete used for blog](assets/images/color-palette.jpg)

* Primary Color
  * CMYK Red (#EC090C)
  * I used this red to symbolise the danger and thrill of drifting

* Secondary Color
  * Davy's Grey (#545454)
  * Davy's Grey is a lighter grey with a very subtle hint of green. I used this cool color as a secondary to contrast the warmer primary

* Primary Accent Color
  * Black (#000000)

* Secondary Accent Color
  * White (#FFFFFF)

### **Icons**

* I used icons from fontawesome for the social media links in the footer to give the website a more modern look

## **Testing**

---

I began testing after deploying the website. From here I made sure all my images loaded and fixed a couple broken file paths.

I then proceeded to test my internal links to make sure they didn't open externally.

From here I did the same with my external links and made sure they opened a new tab.

After this I made sure my form was working correctly and required sections were mandatory.

To finish up I made sure my website was fully responsive and all my elements displayed as I intended them to.
