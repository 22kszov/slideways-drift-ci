                    You have finaly made the first steps to drifting by choosing your car but you are still not quite there. <br>
                    Now comes the part where you get to spend your hard earned cash on modifying it!  <br>
                    Don't know what to do? Not to worry, here is our mod essentials guide for you.

                    Differential
                </h2>

                <p>
                    The job of a differential is to allow your wheels to turn at different speeds.
                    This is essential in daily driving to keep you from losing traction every time you take a bend too hard. <br>
                    When drifting we want to make the loss of traction as easy as possible.
                    There is a budget friendly and a more expensive solution to this. <br>
                    To keep things cheap you can weld your stock diff.
                    This completely eliminates the difference of speed in your wheels allowing you to lose traction with ease. <br>
                    Welding your diff won't cost you more than $50-100 but it isn't a permanent solution.
                    After time your diff will give out but the solution for this is to pick up another from a junkyard for cheap and weld it too.
                    If you don't want to deal with the hassle and are ready to splash a bit of money you can buy a Limited Slip Differential (LSD). <br>
                    An LSD will reduce individual wheelspin. When traction has been broken it will sense this and send power to the wheel with more grip.
                    Altough an LSD is the way too go it can come with a high price tag.
                    After buying your parts and paying for installation you can look anywhere between $700-2000.

                <p>
                    Straightpiping your car has many benefits.
                    The most obvious one is the mean grunt and sheer aggressive loud sound it gives your car even if it's just your nannys 1 litre yaris. <br>
                    The benefit we are trying to achieve by piping our drift car tho is reducing back pressure.
                    When you remove the boring parts of the exhaust like the muffler and the cat and replace it with one bigger pipe you allow better airlow of your exhaust resulting in better performance.

                <p>
                    Altough bucket seats are not necessary they would be one of the first mods for a drift car I reccomend.
                    Their only function isn't only to look cool but to hold you in place securely. <br>
                    When sliding around a corner doing high speeds you will be surprised how much you struggle not to fly out of the car.
                    Buckets are designed to wrap around and minimize how much you roll around. <br>
                    They come with holes to accomodate a harness which we also reccomend.
                    The pair of the buckets and a harness will allow you to take your mind off keeping yourself steady and give full focus to slide your car smoothly.

                    One of the most important things on the track is saftey.
                    Safety regulations can vary track to track so be sure to read the requirements for yours. <br>
                    Nearly all tracks will require tow hooks incase you crash and need to be pulled out.
                    Also a track regulated helmet and neck brace. <br>
                    One of the last things they will also ask for is a fire exstuinguisher bolted to an easy to reach place in the interior of your veichle.
